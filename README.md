## Screenshots 

## Introduction 
personal machine/distro : 
- thinkpad t460
- Arch Linux

dotfiles are for the following configurations :
- gitconfig
- fonts
- kitty 

- htop
- neofetch 

- tmux
- zsh
- starship prompt
- vim       (for very basic, lightweight editing)
- neovim    (for heavy editing and programming)

- zathura pdf viewer
- firefox web browser
 

## Installation
**Warning:**
This is a very personal setup, and I doubt it (b/c its just configuration files), but installation scripts may not work.   
I have not tested on other machines or distros.

#### openSUSE TW
```bash
```
